# Pagination using Next / Prev buttons with API page control

This is a mini React project where I built an image gallery using the Picsum API with pagination functionality.

## 🚀 What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained a **clear and practical understanding of `useEffect`** and why it is used in React.

Initially, I found `useEffect` a little confusing and felt that I wasn’t fully grasping the concept.  
However, after applying it in a real project , handling API calls based on state changes . The concept became much clearer.

This project helped me understand that:
- Learning concepts alone is not enough
- **Applying them in projects makes understanding deeper and long-lasting**

## 🛠️ Features

- Fetch images from an external API using **Axios**
- Pagination using **Next / Prev buttons**
- API calls triggered by state change using **useEffect**
- layout using **Tailwind CSS**
- Clean and minimal UI

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS

### 🙌 Final Thought

This project taught me that building projects is the best way to truly understand React concepts.
I’m excited to keep learning and building more projects 🚀
